With the widespread adoption of mobile networks, the demand for onboard aircraft network connectivity is growing at a significant pace. However, existing solutions for this air-to-ground (ATG) communication scenario, such as satellite communication or 4G/5G ATG communication, fall short in meeting the increasing throughput demands. To address this challenge, leveraging free-space optical (FSO) technology presents a promising opportunity. FSO links have the capability to provide ultra-high throughput up to Tbps[1], offering a significant advantage over RF solutions. However, to ensure the robustness of an ATG FSO link, two key challenges need to be addressed: (i) guaranteeing high-probability link establishment, and (ii) minimizing link loss to ensure reliable communication. In this demonstration, we propose a novel FSO architecture specifically optimized for the ATG scenario. Our design incorporates a retroreflector-based pure-optical feedback mechanism and a self-adaptive tracking and pointing mechanism to tackle these two challenges respectively. To validate the feasibility of our hardware design, we have developed a prototype system and conducted a series of preliminary experiments.
