Hello! I'm Zhaofeng Luo, a passionate undergraduate student at the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science at Peking University. 
## Academic Interests
 I've spent a year researching wireless communication, focusing on developing optical feedback architectures for high-mobility wireless laser links. Currently, my interests have shifted to physics-based simulations, particularly in real-time 3D modeling and interactions.
